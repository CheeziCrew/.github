# Welcome to CheeziCrew!

We specialize in scripts for handling bulk operations. Our tools are designed to make managing multiple repositories a breeze.

## Our Tools

### Swissgit
Swissgit is the coolest, jankiest Go solution for:
- Dishing out pull requests
- Making commits
- Handling git status in hundreds of repos with just a few simple commands

Swissgit comes compiled in binaries for all platforms.

### Changelogmaker
Changelogmaker is an ultra-specific, janky Python tool that compares two `openapi.yml` files. It also comes with compiled binaries for Windows and Mac.

## Contributions
We love contributions, big or small! Feedback is always welcome.

## Meet Theo
Theo the cat is our mascot. He loves cuddles and hates it when his food is late.
